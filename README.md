Not supported:

- [ ] [react-native-screens/createNativeStackNavigator](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/react-navigation-shared-element/issues/14)

## Known issues

Navigating to a screen on Android causes the target element to blink when unhiding. This problem needs to be investigated further, but can be worked around by [disabling `react-native-screens` explicitly](./example/src/App.tsx#L50-L55).

```jsx
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

// As of react-native-screens@2.14.0, enableScreens causes a fade-in of the image when navigating to a screen.
// And as of react-native-screens@3, enableScreens is enabled by default.
// Disable screens on Android until this issue has been resolved.
enableScreens(Platform.OS !== "android");
```
